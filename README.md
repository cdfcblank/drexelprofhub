# warning
This project is only for purposes of reviewing the existing code. Without the correct database layout and node modules, it will not function properly.

# description
This project was submitted in 2020 as a demo of a class scheduling system for professors. Classes were stored within a database hosted on an old computer, and were able to be edited/created via HTTP requests via input from HTML forms generated by user input.

Unfortunately, since I don't have access to the database anymore because this was developed in class (which is the case for all of the back-end projects I can currently access) the localhost test pages won't work anymore. Still, the code is viewable in a text editor.

"professorhub.js" contains the code responsible for receiving and formatting a single professor's classes based on the information present on the professorhub.html page.

"createclass.js" contains the code responsible for organizing a user's input when creating a class, and "editclass.js" does the same when editing a class.

"s_drexelattend.js" is what manages user requests to other files when loading onto pages.
